# Content Analyzer Sample Tools

This repository contains two types of IBM Business Automation Content Analyzer sample Tools. One is a desktop application that has been built for Windows and for MacOS platforms, the other is a Python script package.

The sample tools can be used for uploading files, checking processing status, downloading and deleting files via the IBM Business Automation Content Analyzer APIs. The sample tools can be used as a companion tool to your new Content Analyzer solution.

### Introduction
The IBM Business Automation Content Analyzer is a cloud-based API web service that can help you rapidly accelerate extraction and classification of data in your documents. Content Analyzer can digitize, classify and extract unstructured document content using OCR and PDF text extraction, and enable Watson and other AI technologies to reveal business insight from your documentation.

Once you have used the web interface to “train” your Content Analyzer instance to recognize your specific ontology of document classes, you will need to incorporate the Content Analyzer API calls into your workflow to integrate the data extraction and document classification capabilities.

Instead of waiting for your custom application to be written to call the Content Analyzer APIs, you can use this sample tool to get started right away. This sample tool can be installed on any system that has the python compiler and is written with the Content Analyzer RESTful APIs as a quick verification tool for your ontology and to jump start your integration. With a simple configuration file, the API Sample tool allows you to upload multiple documents, and automatically download the requested output files.

### Basic Components
+ [**WindowsMac**](WindowsMac) - This folder contains the installation packages for the Windows and MacOS desktop application.
+ [**Python**](Python) - This folder contains the python scripts for API uploading, processing, downloading and deleting.
+ [**C#**](C%23) - This folder contains the C# solution for API uploading, processing, downloading and deleting.

### Configuration Information
Both of these sample tools need configuration information before running. Please look at the readme file in each folder for more detail.
