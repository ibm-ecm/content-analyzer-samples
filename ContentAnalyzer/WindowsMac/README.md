### Troubleshooting
July 2019: Updated with the June 2019 Version 1.1 of Content Analyzer. If you are still using the Version 1.0 on the
server, you may see this error.

Error CIWCA16004: Values in jsonOptions are invalid. This is because jsonOptions have been changed in between version
1.0 and 1.1. To fix this, go into the Settings page and make sure you unselect (1) AI Integrations, (2) Document
Segmentation, and (3) Character OCR. Save and retry the file upload.
